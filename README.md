# 3D Developer Portfolio

Welcome to the 3D Developer Portfolio built with **React.js**, **Three.js**, **React Three Fiber**, and **TailwindCSS**. This portfolio demonstrates my development skills with an immersive 3D hacker room, interactive features, and a modern design to showcase my projects, timeline, and achievements. 

## ü§ñ Introduction
This project is designed to showcase a developer's skills in a visually engaging way using 3D elements and smooth animations. The portfolio includes a **dynamic hero section**, **interactive about me**, **project showcase**, and much more to provide a unique experience for visitors.

It is built using **React.js** for the frontend, with **Three.js** for rendering 3D elements and **React Three Fiber** to integrate 3D scenes into the React application. The design is styled using **TailwindCSS** to create a clean and responsive layout.
